<p>This document specifies filenames using <b><font color="#009900">green
bold text </font></b>and notices and warnings in <b><font
 color="#990000">bold red text</font></b>. These instructions are for
either <b>first time installation</b> or <b>upgrading an old
installation</b>. Where differences exist between new installations and
upgrading, they will be identified in the instructions below.</p>
<p><b>A note about upgrading:</b> The install scripts are designed to
automatically upgrade a previously installed ORS installation without
losing any of the existing configuration of the system (including
resources, users, and program configuration settings). As such,
upgrading only requires that you perform steps 1-4 of this guide. This
includes uploading the new files to your server and rerunning the
install script. After upgrading, you may want to review the program
configuration settings in case new features have been added which you
want to customize.</p>

<p><font color="#990000"><b>REQUIREMENTS:</b></font> PHP version 4.0.5
or higher, Apache server (recommended), and approx. 2 Mb of server
space.</p>
<p><b>1) Unzip the ORS zip file</b> this should create three folders:
"install", "help" and &quot;jscalendar-1.0&quot;. Please read the <a href="license.html">license.html
file</a> before continuing.</p>
<p><b><a name="step2">2) NEW INSTALLATIONS: </a> Create a new folder
on your web site </b>to hold the scheduler. This document will assume
the folder is named "scheduling" but it can be named anything you wish.
After creating this folder, you should upload (FTP) the "install" and
"help" folders and all files contained in them, into your scheduling
folder (You should do this using an "FTP" client; if you are unfamiliar
with FTP, take a look at <a href="http://tutorial.ftpplanet.com/LE/">http://tutorial.ftpplanet.com/LE/</a>).</p>
<p><b>UPGRADING: Upload the new ORS files to the existing install
folder on your web site. </b>You should overwrite any files in the
install folder with these new files.</p>
<p><b><a name="step3"></a>3) Point a browser to the page:
http://www.mysite.com/scheduling/install/index.html</b> ( replace
"www.mysite.com/" with your web-site address such as
"www.blarg.net/~myname/" ) You should see the initial installation page
with a link to start that the first step of the installation. Click on
this link. When the first stage is completed, you will see a message
that you should click another link to continue the installation. If the
first stage completed successfully, continue to the <a href="#step4">next
step</a> of this guide.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#990000"><b>TROUBLESHOOTING:<br>
  </b></font>* If you receive the message:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Warning:</b> fopen("../test.txt", "w+") - Permission denied

    <p><b>We were unable to write to the base scheduling folder

permissions on the base folder to "world writeable" to install ORS (you
can reset them back to standard permissions after installation). Please
see the installation instructions for more information.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>the problem is that the PHP system is unable to write into the
base <b><font color="#009900">scheduling</font></b> folder. You must
either (1) determine if your web host allows you to run PHP as a "CGI"
and run it that way (As a CGI, PHP which will often be run with your
user permissions, and thus will be able to write to the <b><font
 color="#009900">scheduling</font></b> folder. How you run as a CGI
depends on your web host, contact them)<i> OR</i> (2) you must
temporarily set permissions on the base <b><font color="#009900">scheduling</font></b>
folder to allow the "world" (aka "other" or "everyone") to be able to
write to the folder (chmod scheduling 777, You do this in your FTP
client; look for help on "chmod" or "file permissions". After
installation you <b>must</b> reset the permissions on this folder so
that the "world" can only read and execute this folder, chmod
scheduling 755).</p>

  <p><font color="#990000"><b>REMINDER:</b></font> If you had to set

</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="step4"></a>4) Click on the "continue installation" link</b>.
After the second stage is completed, click on the final link and the
configuration page will automatically be brought up (normally, this
page can be reached using an administrator account and going to the <a
 href="#maintenancemenu">Utilities Menu</a>, selecting "More..." and
selecting "Program Configuration"). You MUST select "update
configuration" to finish the installation.</p>

 href="#faq_2">FAQ question relating to this issue</a>.</p>
  <p>* If you are using a Mac running OS X (and maybe some other
systems!) and you make it through the previous step without any
problems but, upon "Continuing Installation" of the scheduler, you
receive the message:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Warning:</b> fopen("<i>[somefolder]</i>/scheduling/data/scheduling.lock",
"w") - Permission denied in <i>[somefolder]</i>/scheduling/functions.php

  </blockquote>
  <p>You must read the <a href="#faq_3">FAQ question relating to this
issue</a>.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><b><font color="#990000">NOTE:</font></b> <br>
* The default administrator password is "letmein" and the default
password to change program configuration is "superpass".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>5)</b> <b>CHANGE THE ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD:</b> If you do not
do so, anyone who knows the default password can mess with your
settings very disastrously!</p>
<p><b>6) </b><i><b>CHANGE THE ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD!!!</b></i> We really mean 
  it! (write it down somewhere) You can also make any user an administrator in 
  the User Management page. If you forget this password, see the <a href="#faq_lostpw">FAQ 
  question relating to this issue</a>.</p>
<p><b>7) Consider changing the program configuration password</b> too.
The importance of this depends on the security required for your site.
Only administrators can modify the configuration settings. Obviously,
only those administrators who know the configuration password can
modify the configuration settings. If you have only one administrator,
then the password could be set to nothing to make it easier to set the
configuration.</p>
<p><b>8) Review the other configuration settings.</b> Take special note
of the URL settings such as the e-mail addresses. Set these to
something other than the default e-mail address. After modifying
settings, click the "Save Changes" button to save the settings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><font color="#990000">NOTE:<br>
  </font></b>* Various settings require you to enter very big values in
SECONDS (PHP uses units of seconds for time). To make this easier to
read by YOU, you can use multiplication symbols. So instead of entering
a backup interval of 7 days as 604800 seconds, enter it as 7*24*60*60
(7 days times 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>9) Use the <a href="#resource">"Resource Management" page</a></b>
to add resources (see notes below)</p>
<p><b>10) Use the <a href="#user">"User Management" page</a> </b>to
add users (see notes below)</p>
<p><b>11) Custom configuration options:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> You can add a custom image to the login screen (it will take the
place of the default "ORS" graphic) by renaming your file
"scheduling.gif", uploading the image file into the <b><font
 color="#009900">scheduling/install</font></b> folder and repeating
ONLY <a href="#step3">step 3</a> of these instructions.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> You can add a background image to all screens by modifying the <b><font
 color="#009900">defaults.php</font></b> line.</li>
  <pre>define ("page_background", ""); //image for background      of scheduler pages<br></pre>
and uploading your image to the main scheduling folder.
</ul>
<p><font color="#990000"><b>NOTE: </b></font>Depending on the exact
installation settings of PHP on your web site server, there are a
variety of ways that the installation of ORS will vary. What we have
just described here are the steps which <i>should</i> get ORS working
on most systems no matter how secure the PHP installation. See the FAQ
at the bottom of this document for more information.</p>

<h2>I've forgotten my Administrator Password or Configuration Password!
What can I do?</h2>
<p>In the downloads section of the ORS website (<a href="http://ors.sourceforge.net">http://ors.sourceforge.net</a>), 
  you can download the &quot;ResetPassword&quot; utility. This function, when 
  uploaded to your main scheduling folder, should safely reset the administrator 
  password. <font color="#990000"> <b>Make sure you delete the resetpassword file 
  after using it! </b></font>Otherwise, someone else could force the password 
  to be reset and, thus, have access to your administrator account!</p>
<hr>
<div align="right"><a name="faq_1"></a><a href="#FAQ">[Back to FAQs]</a>
</div>
<p></p>
<h2>Why can't I read or modify the ORS files or the data or backup
folders? </h2>
<p>Depending on how your web site host is set up, the ORS program might
create files which are not readable by you when you FTP into your
website.</p>
<p><b>Short answer:</b> Don't worry about it. If you use the "backup"
feature of the ORS, you will not need to manually backup these files.
They can all be restored from the e-mailed backup files. If you need to
do this, just follow the instructions provided by "restore from backup"
in the "more..." maintenance menu.</p>
<p> <b>Long answer: </b>In some installations of PHP (the language
ORS is written in), for scripts to write to a file, the file must be
owned by the same user who is running the PHP interpreter. On most
systems, this user will be something like "web" (not a normal user like
you but a sort of "ghost" user which serves the files). ORS deals with
this by creating all of its files itself and then setting permissions
of these files so that only that user can read them. </p>
<p>If you want to read or modify the files in the data folder, you can <i>temporarily</i> 
  make these files accessible by logging into the scheduler as an administrator, 
  going to the "Maintenance" menu and selecting "Unlock Data Folder". This will 
  unlock the root data folder, allowing you access. Once done, you should relock 
  the root folder by selecting "Lock Data Folder" from the maintenance menu. </p>
<p>If you cannot log into your scheduler to unlock it, the downloads section of 
  the ORS website (<a href="http://ors.sourceforge.net">http://ors.sourceforge.net</a>) 
  has a &quot;ForceUnlock&quot; utility which performs the same action as the 
  above command. </p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are blessed, your server might be running a special form 
  of PHP which will allow PHP to run under <i>your</i> name. In this mode, the 
  files will all be owned by you and you can read and write them as you wish. 
  You might want to contact your server administrator and ask them if they allow 
  running "PHP as a CGI" (don't worry if you don't know what it means, just ask 
  it and hope they say "yes"!) If so, you should try creating, in your root scheduling 
  folder, a file named ".htaccess" which contains this single line:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>AddType php-cgi .php</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will allow ORS to pretend it is <i>you</i> when it is running
and all the files it creates will be accessible by you.</p>
<hr>
<div align="right"><a name="faq_2"></a><a href="#FAQ">[Back to FAQs]</a></div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>During installation I got the message:</h3>
<h3></h3>
<blockquote>
  <h3>Attempt to create root_dir .htaccess file <font color="#990000">FAILED</font></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>For some reason, your data folder was <b>not protected from
Internet users</b> browsing your files. You should secure your users'
personal information by creating a file named <b><font color="#009900">.htaccess</font></b>
containing the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;Limit GET&gt;<br>Order Deny,Allow<br>Deny from All<br>&lt;/Limit&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>then upload this file (using FTP) to your scheduling/data folder. If
you cannot write to this folder, see the unlockroot instructions under
the FAQ question: <a href="#faq_1"> <b>"Why can't I read or modify
the ORS files or the data or backup folders?"</b></a></p>

  <p><b>Warning:</b> fopen("<i>[somefolder]</i>/scheduling/data/scheduling.lock",
"w") - Permission denied in <i>[somefolder]</i>/scheduling/functions.php
on line<i> [some line]</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The web server doesn't have permissions to modify the files in the
scheduling/data folder. Check with your system administrator but you
will probably need to change the entire /scheduling folder and all it's
contents to be owned by the group "web" or "www" (depending on your
system setup). This will make the scheduling files accessable to the
web server.</p>

<div align="right"><a name="newextension"></a><a href="#FAQ">[Back to

<h3>My web host requires that my PHP files be named something other
than ".php" to be executed.</h3>
<p>If your web host requires that your PHP files be named something <b>other</b>
than ".php" (for example, some require ".php4") there are two options
for solving this problem:</p>
<p><b>Option 1:</b> Create a configuration file which instructs the web
server to interpret ".php" as ".php4". </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>On Apache servers,</b> this can be usually accomplished by
creating two identical files named ".htaccess" containing the text: </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>AddType application/x-httpd-php4 .php</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These files should be created in the base scheduling folder and
the <b><font color="#009900">install</font></b> folder.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>On Netscape servers,</b> this can usually be accomplished by
creating two identical files named ".nsconfig" containing the text: </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <pre>&lt;Files *.php&gt;<br>AddType exp=*.php type=application/x-httpd-php4<br>&lt;/Files&gt;</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These files should be created in the base scheduling folder and
the <b><font color="#009900">install</font></b> folder.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>Contact your web host for information regarding other web
servers.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Option 2:</b> (if option 1 is not possible) Edit the <b><font
 color="#009900">install/default.php</font></b> file and locate the
line which reads: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>define("required_php_extension", ".php");</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>On this line, you can insert the correct extension in place of
".php". Next, rename the <b><font color="#009900">install/install.php</font></b>
file to have the correct extension (rename <b>ONLY</b> this file! The
others will be renamed automatically) and then repeat <a href="#step3">step
3</a> of the installation instructions.</p>

<div align="right"><a name="uninstall"></a><a href="#FAQ">[Back to FAQs]</a>
</div>
<h2>How do I uninstall ORS?</h2>
<p>Two methods:</p>
<p>(A) From the Maintenance/More... menu (accessible only as an administrator), 
  select &quot;Restore From Backup&quot;. From the Available Backup File list, 
  select &quot;** Uninstall ORS Database **&quot;. This will remove all the Data 
  files. The remaining files in the scheduling folder can usually be deleted using 
  any standard FTP program. See note below if you are unable to remove the remaining 
  files.</p>
<p>(B) To uninstall ORS, you should first use the maintenance menu to unlock the 
  data folder (If you can't log in or otherwise access this folder, the downloads 
  section of the ORS website, <a href="http://ors.sourceforge.net">http://ors.sourceforge.net</a>, 
  has a &quot;ForceUnlock&quot; utility which performs the same action). You can 
  then simply delete the entire scheduling folder as desired. </p>
<p>If you are still unable to remove all the files and folders from the scheduling 
  folder, contact your system administrator. An administrator can always remove 
  the folder and its contents. Nothing is stored outside of the base scheduling 
  folder.<br>
