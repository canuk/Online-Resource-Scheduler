  <p align="left"><b>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</b></p>
  <p align="left">0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under 
    the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, 
    refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; 
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that 
    is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim 
    or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, 
    translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) 
    Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
  <p align="left">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification 
    are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered 
    only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of 
    having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on 
    what the Program does.</p>
  <p align="left">1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
    and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program 
    a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
  <p align="left">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for 
    a fee.</p>
  <p align="left">2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any 
    portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute 
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that 
    you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
  <p align="left">a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
  <p align="left">b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that 
    in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, 
    to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms 
    of this License.</p>
  <p align="left">c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use 
    in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
    saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
    under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print 
    such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
    an announcement.)</p>
  <p align="left">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can 
    be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then 
    this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute 
    them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part 
    of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole 
    must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees 
    extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of 
    who wrote it.</p>
  <p align="left">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or 
    contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is 
    to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective 
    works based on the Program.</p>
  <p align="left">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
    Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume 
    of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
    scope of this License.</p>
  <p align="left">3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based 
    on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms 
    of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
  <p align="left">a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
    above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
  <p align="left">b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
    source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on 
    a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
  <p align="left">c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the 
    offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed 
    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in 
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection 
    b above.)</p>
  <p align="left">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work 
    for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code 
    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated 
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, 
    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that 
    component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
  <p align="left">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to 
    copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source 
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along 
    with the object code.</p>
  <p align="left">4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
  <p align="left">5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have 
    not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute 
    the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if 
    you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of 
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing 
    or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
  <p align="left">6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based 
    on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original 
    licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms 
    and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
    exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
    compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
  <p align="left">7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of 
    patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) 
    that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from 
    the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
    simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
    obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
    For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
    of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
    you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be 
    to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
  <p align="left">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable 
    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended 
    to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
  <p align="left">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe 
    any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such 
    claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the 
    free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license 
    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range 
    of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
    of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose 
    that choice.</p>
  <p align="left">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed 
    to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
  <p align="left">8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted 
    in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
    geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution 
    is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this 
    License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
  <p align="left">9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new 
    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions 
    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail 
    to address new problems or concerns.</p>
  <p align="left">Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the 
    Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 
    &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms 
    and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number 
    of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
    Foundation.</p>
  <p align="left">10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other 
    free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
    to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
    for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free 
    status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing 
    and reuse of software generally.</p>
  <p align="left">NO WARRANTY</p>
  <p align="left">11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS 
    NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT 
    WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
    EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
    OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM 
    PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
    CORRECTION.</p>
  <p align="left">12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
    TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU 
    OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), 
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
    SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
